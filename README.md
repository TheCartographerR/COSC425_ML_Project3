# COSC425_ML_Project3
Project 3: k-Nearest-Neighbors and Decision Trees. In this project we applied k-nearest-neighbors and decision trees to the diagnosis of breast cancer. 


The breast-cancer-wisconsin.data file contains the following attributes:

1. Sample code number: id number
2. Clump Thickness: 1 – 10
3. Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 – 10
4. Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 – 10
5. Marginal Adhesion: 1 – 10
6. Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 – 10
7. Bare Nuclei: 1 – 10
8. Bland Chromatin: 1 – 10
9. Normal Nucleoli: 1 – 10
10. Mitoses: 1 – 10
11. Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)


The goal of the project is to diagnosis breast cancer by using the classifier 2 or 4 for benign and malignant respectively for the given cell information.
